    "The ultimate goal of this exercise is to compare the position of stars in a patch of sky as measured in two different surveys. The main task at hand is to identify matching positions of stars between the surveys. For this, we will need to compare the positions of all stars in one survey to the position of all stars in the other survey. This task can be extremely time consuming if not implemented properly, we will therefore use this to compare different coding style and their impact on computation time. \n",
